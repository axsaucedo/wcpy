        # Dependencies
        
        ## Install VirtualEnv and Requirements
        
        Python 3.X is used, and it's strongly recommended to set up the project in a virtual environment:
        
        ```
        virtualenv --no-site-packages -p python3 venv
        ```
        
        Then install the requirements as per requirements.txt:
        
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## NLTK
        
        I am using the NLTK data package, so you need to make sure you install it with the following command:
        
        ```
        python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
        ```
        
        
        # Testing
        
        Py.test is used to run the tests, in order to run it simply run:
        
        ```
        python setup.py test
        ```
        
        # Cleaning
        
        To clean all the files generated during runtime simply run:
        
        ```
        python setup.py clean
        ```
